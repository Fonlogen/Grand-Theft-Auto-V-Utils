Here you can find all the informations and utilities for modding GTA V!

## Original game files backup and restore

It's very important to take a backup of the original game files if you want go online. Modified game files and/or scripthook will prevent you from going online, but if you modify original RPF files, GTA V will alert you with the message "Modified files found in GTA V folder". If you go online with that modified files, you will be banned. You can keep track of original game files or modded file using my [Mod Manager](https://github.com/Fonlogen/Fonlogen-Mod-Manager-V) software, that you can find on my GitHub repository. **IMPORTANT** - This software cannot track if you have modded RPF file, but only for new files in the main game folder. If you have a modded rpf file and don't have a backup, you can use the RG Launcher option "Verify game integrity", same alternative in Steam / Epic Games launcher, but remember that this operation will **DELETE** all your mods / modded files, restoring the original game files.

## Before starting / Tools that you will need

You will need the following tools to start modding your GTA V:
#### [Fonlogen's Mod Manager (Optional)](https://github.com/Fonlogen/Fonlogen-Mod-Manager-V)
I created this software to help the creation of "Modded Profiles" for GTA V. For example, i can have the profile "Rockstar Editor", with mods aimed for the rockstar editor movie making, and the profile "Epic graphics", with mods that full remake GTA V graphics for realism. With this tool you don't have to manually move the mods in the GTA V folder, but you can just create profiles and save the current mods or switch between the profiles only pressing a button. This tool also auto-recognize original game files, adding a gta icon on the right side of the file, that means you are viewing an original game file. I recommend you to use this tool if you are not very expert with GTA V Mods files or general game modding.

#### [ScriptHookV](http://www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/)
This is the father, the core of all GTA V mods. Whether it's a graphics mod or adding flying cars you will need ScriptHookV. The installation is really simple. Just drag and drop all the .zip content in your main GTA V folder (Example: Drag and drop all files in C:\Games\Grand Theft Auto V)

#### [OpenIV](https://openiv.com)
