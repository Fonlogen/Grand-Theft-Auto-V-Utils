## Original game files backup and restore

It's very important to take a backup of the original game files if you want go online. Modified game files and/or scripthook will prevent you from going online, but if you modify original RPF files, GTA V will alert you with the message "Modified files found in GTA V folder". If you go online with that modified files, you will be banned. You can keep track of original game files or modded file using my Mod Manager software, that you can find on my GitHub repository. **IMPORTANT** - This software cannot track if you have modded RPF file, but only for new files in the main game folder. If you have a modded rpf file and don't have a backup, you can use the RG Launcher option "Verify game integrity", same alternative in Steam / Epic Games launcher, but remember that this operation will **DELETE** all your mods / modded files, restoring the original game files.
